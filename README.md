**Objective**:         

The primary objective of this Python code is to create a simple grade management system that allows users to input grades for different subjects or assignments, calculate the average grade, and determine the corresponding letter grade.

**Key Activities:**        
**Input:** The code prompts the user to enter the name of a subject or assignment and the corresponding grade.       
**Data Storage**: The entered grades are stored in a list.       
**Average Calculation:** The calculate_average function is called to compute the average of the stored grades.       
**Letter Grade Determination**: The get_letter_grade function is called to determine the letter grade based on the average grade.      
**Output**: The average grade and letter grade are printed to the console.         
**Technologies Used:**         

**Python:** The code is written in Python, a popular high-level programming language.    
**Input/Output**: The input and print functions are used for user interaction and displaying results.       
**Data Structures:** A list is used to store the grades.      
**Functions:** The calculate_average and get_letter_grade functions are defined to encapsulate specific tasks.      
**Key Insights:**   
 
**Modularity:** The code is organized into well-defined functions, making it easier to understand and maintain.     
**Flexibility:** The code can be easily adapted to different grading scales or additional features.      
**Error Handling:** While not explicitly implemented in this code, it could be enhanced by adding error handling to validate user input and handle potential exceptions.      
**Efficiency**: The calculate_average function efficiently computes the average using the sum and len functions.   
**Clarity:** The code is well-structured and uses clear variable names and comments to improve readability.
